# Per-Language Guide: PHP

PHP's design quirks — `$variable` prefix on every variable, `$this`
for instance reference, `.` for string concatenation (not `+`), no
type system before PHP 7 — make it stylistically distinct from the
C-family default. Frame source for PHP looks similar at the
state-machine level but uses PHP-native syntax inside handler
bodies.

This guide documents the PHP-specific patterns. It assumes you are
already familiar with Frame's core syntax and PHP basics
(`<?php`, `$variables`, `$this`, classes, namespaces).

For the canonical capability table, see
`framepiler_test_env/docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md`. PHP is
fully spec-conformant; `async` is the only language-natural skip
(no native async/await).

## Foundation: class with `$this`-prefixed members

A Frame system targeting PHP generates a single `.php` file
containing:

- A `<?php` header (declared in the prolog).
- A `class WithInterface { ... }` with member fields and methods.
- A `function __construct() { ... }` constructor that fires the
  start-state's `$>` cascade.
- One `function greet(string $name): string` method per
  interface entry.

```php
<?php

class WithInterface {
    public $call_count = 0;
    // ... runtime fields

    function __construct() {
        // start-state $> cascade fires here
    }

    function greet(string $name): string {
        // ... handler body
        return $result;
    }
}
```

Frame's `self.field` lowers to `$this->field` (PHP's instance
reference is `$this` and member access uses `->`).

---

## Domain fields: typed members with default initializers

Domain fields lower to public members:

```frame
domain:
    call_count: int = 0
    name: str = "alice"
```

```php
public $call_count = 0;
public $name = "alice";
```

PHP 7.4+ supports typed properties. Frame's `: int` lowers to
`int $call_count = 0;` for typed-property targets. For PHP 7.0–7.3,
type annotations on properties don't compile — declare without
the type or upgrade the target.

---

## Strings: `.` for concat, `"$var"` interpolation

PHP uses `.` (period) for string concatenation, not `+`.
Double-quoted strings interpolate variables directly (`"$name"`)
or with braces for complex expressions (`"{$obj->field}"`):

```frame
$Ready {
    greet(name: str): str {
        $this->call_count += 1
        @@:("Hello, " . $name . "!")
        return
    }
}
```

```php
function greet(string $name): string {
    $this->call_count += 1;
    return "Hello, " . $name . "!";
}
```

Note the `.` instead of `+` — this is PHP-specific. Frame doesn't
auto-translate `+` to `.`; you must write `.` in PHP source.

For interpolation:

```frame
$Active {
    log() {
        $this->message = "count={$this->count}, name={$this->name}"
    }
}
```

Curly braces are required when interpolating object members
(`{$obj->field}`) — the bare `"$obj->field"` form is
context-sensitive.

## No async — language-natural skip

PHP has no native async/await. The matrix capability table shows
PHP's async row as 🚫 (language-natural skip). Asynchronous work
in PHP typically uses:

- ReactPHP (event loop + promises) for async I/O.
- Swoole (extension-based async runtime) for concurrent
  request handling.
- Plain `pcntl_fork` for OS-level concurrency.

These are user concerns. The state machine itself is single-
process synchronous.

---

## Cross-system fields: direct instantiation

`var counter: Counter = @@Counter()` lowers to a member field
instantiated via `new Counter()` in the constructor. The
phase7_multisys round landed the PHP tagged-init constructor
body fix:

```php
class Embedding {
    public $counter;

    function __construct() {
        $this->counter = new Counter();
        // start-state $> fires
    }

    function notify() {
        $this->counter->bump(1);
    }
}
```

Calls to `self.counter.bump(n)` lower to `$this->counter->bump(n)`
— note the `->` chain.

---

## Loop idioms — both work

PHP has `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `foreach`. Frame's idiom
1 (`while cond { ... }`) compiles to a native PHP `while` block
via passthrough.

---

## Multi-system per file: works as you'd expect

A `.fphp` source containing multiple `@@system` blocks compiles
to a single `.php` file with multiple class definitions. PHP has
no per-file class limit.

---

## Comments and the Oceans Model

Frame's "Oceans Model" applies to PHP the same way it applies
to every other backend. The comment leaders are `//` (line),
`#` (also line, PHP-specific), and `/* ... */` (block).

```frame
@@target php
<?php

// Module-prolog block — passes through as PHP source.

@@system Counter {
    machine:
        // Section-level comments are preserved as native // blocks.
        $Counting {
            tick() { ... }
        }
}
```

## Idiomatic patterns and common gotchas

**`$this->field`, not `self.field` or `$this.field`.** PHP uses
`->` for object member access (not `.`). Frame's `self.x` lowers
to `$this->x`. Frame state-vars `$.x` lower to compartment
access — internally framec handles this.

**`new` for class instantiation.** Frame's `@@WithInterface()`
lowers to `new WithInterface()`.

**Variable prefix `$`.** Every PHP variable starts with `$`.
Frame doesn't auto-prefix — handler-local declarations should
write `$x = 0` explicitly.

**`null` is the absent-value marker.** Same as Python's `None`,
JS's `undefined` (but distinct).

**`strict_types=1` for type enforcement.** Adding
`declare(strict_types=1);` to the prolog enforces the
type-hints; without it, PHP coerces silently. Frame doesn't
auto-emit this declaration.

**`echo` and `print` for output, not `console.log`.** PHP's
`echo "Hello\n";` is the standard print idiom. The Frame
matrix harness uses `echo` for assertion output.
