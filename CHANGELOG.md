## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Async codegen for six new targets: Dart (`Future<T> foo() async`), GDScript (bare `await`), Kotlin (`suspend fun`), Swift (`func … async`; async entry renamed to `initAsync` since `init` is reserved), C# (`async Task<T>`), Java (`CompletableFuture<T>` on the public interface only — internal dispatch stays sync; callers `.get()`), and C++23 (`FrameTask<T>` coroutine promise emitted header-guarded at file scope). Total: 11 of 17 targets now produce real async code.
- C backend double-return marshalling — per-system `Sys_pack_double` / `Sys_unpack_double` `memcpy`-based helpers for handlers declared `float` / `double`. The `void*` return slot previously truncated fractional parts via `intptr_t`.
- C backend pointer-type parameter support — `fmt_unpack` and `fmt_bind_param` now pass types ending in `*` through as-is instead of defaulting to `int`.
- Erlang `@@:self.method(args)` full semantics — Data threading (via the existing classifier) plus transition-guard `case ...#data.frame_current_state of` wrappers around each dispatch site, so a state change inside the called handler short-circuits the rest of the caller's body.
- GDScript `@@Foo()` in domain initializers now emits `Foo.new()` (was `Foo()`, parsed as a function call on a null instance).
- Dart persist codegen updated to match the post–HashMap→Vec compartment shape (state_args / enter_args / exit_args as `List<dynamic>`, not `Map`); `_restore()` constructor initializes `late` fields; domain-field restore uses `.cast<X>()` for typed containers.
- Pop enter-args (`-> ($.items) pop$`) now routes each arg through `expand_expression` with the handler's context, so Frame sigils (`$.items`, `self.field`, `@@:params.name`) resolve to their language-specific accessors.
- C++ target pinned to C++23 (`cpp_23` alias added; `cpp` / `cpp_17` / `cpp_20` still resolve to the same backend but generated coroutine code needs `-std=c++20`+).
- Cookbook recipes #53 Byte Scanner and #54 Pushdown Parser — composed scanner + parser pipeline demonstrating Frame's `@@:self` for delimiter replay and `push$` / `pop$` as a call stack.

### Fixed

- Erlang RecordUpdate codegen strips trailing `,` / `.` from the update value — `self.count = self.count + 1,` (with Erlang statement separator attached) was emitting `Data#data{count = ... ,}` with a trailing comma inside the record-update braces, a parse error.
- Docker harness: `lua_batch.sh` now prefers `lua5.4` (Ubuntu's `lua` is 5.1 and rejects `::label::`/`goto`); `lua-cjson` installs for 5.4; `TestRunner.cs` moved `Console.SetOut` before `Task.Run` to close a race that leaked phantom TAP lines.
- Kotlin test image pulls `kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm.jar`.

### Changed

- Integration matrix: **17 / 17 clean, 3,377 passed / 0 failed / 29 skipped** — all 29 skips are legitimate language-incompat with clear inline comments. Down from 71 skips at the start of the 2026-04-20 session (42 framec-gap tests burned down). Ten languages at zero skips.
- Unit tests: 244 → 370.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- 8 experimental backends: Kotlin, Swift, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Erlang, Dart, GDScript
- GraphViz DOT output for state chart visualization
- Hierarchical state machine (HSM) support with explicit parent forwarding
- Async/await support for Python, TypeScript, and Rust
- State persistence with `@@persist` annotation
- System context (`@@`) for interface parameter access, return values, and call-scoped data
- State variables (`$.varName`) with per-state scope
- State stack operations (`push$` / `pop$`) for history transitions
- Multi-system file support
- Project-level compilation with `compile-project` command
- WASM compilation target for browser-based transpilation
- Comprehensive validation with 40+ error codes
